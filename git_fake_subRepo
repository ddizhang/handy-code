#add a subdirectory of a git repo into another git repo, 
#so that you can have different version control on both parent repo and sub repo. 
#And you can commute with others on the sub repo without exposing your parent repo

git clone <parentRepoPath> parentRepo
cd parentRepo

git clone <subRepoPath> subRepo  #a subRepo is build as a in parentRepo/subRepo

git add subRepo/  #The slash is vital! This way, the parentRepo git driver will add everything in subRepo disgard that it's a git repo itself. Otherwise, subRepo will be considered as a submoduel.

#about pushing

If in parentRepo and outside subRepo, commits will be made to parentRepo.

if pushed from subRepo, only subRepo (and commits from subRepo) will be pushed.
if pushed from parentRepo, only parentRepo (and commits from parentRepo) will be pushed.
